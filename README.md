Apologies for errors in translation. I unfortunately do not speak Ukrainian.

I do not belong to any company or organization but provide these posters privately. It is important to me that these posters should not attack anyone personally.

The posters are intended exclusively for peaceful demonstrations against the Ukraine war.

Please print the posters on 3 x 3 A4 pages, stick them on a piece of cardboard, write your city and the current date on it and go demonstrate.

I hope that the people in Ukraine and the people in Russia will see that many cities around the world are taking to the streets in different places and on different days. The name of the city and the date should help to show that these demonstrations are not fake news or something like that.

Let's support Ukraine to end the war as soon as possible.
Please feel free to share this link.

I continue to work on new posters and ideas.
